                            <p>A building management company must have a security management division. It is in charge of establishing and upholding a secure environment for the residents and other important stakeholders. Many procedures must be followed to make the facility secure. A security audit is where it all starts. It is a mandatory process. With the aid of a security consultant, it also comprises an assessment of the security system and procedures. Depending on the findings of the audit, we will then choose what measurements to make.</p>

                            <p>We take into account a few key elements when estimating the price of a new building automation system.</p>
                            <li>Size (total square footage)</li>
                            <li>Type of building (s)</li>
                            <li>Integratable systems like lighting, HVAC systems, fire, security, and access control</li>
                            <p className='pt-2'>In general, the price of a building automation system ranges from $2.50 to $7.50 per square foot.</p>
                            <p className='pt-3'>The following variables may also have an impact on the price:</p>
                            <li>Whether or not the system is being installed in a brand-new structure.</li>
                            <li>if a new system is installed in an old structure.</li>
                            <li>if it is an update from a legacy building automation system that is older.</li>
                            <li>It is simple to see why a data center would cost more per square foot than a standard office building, for instance.</li>

                            <h2 className='font-semibold text-lg text-[#0F75BC] pt-5'>Why do You Need a Building Management System?</h2>
                            <p>The benefits of installing an efficient and reliable Building Management System with a good track record are limitless. The benefits include operating cost reductions, safety, staff productivity, security, and the safety of your long-term investment.</p>
                            <li>A well-designed system can save operational costs by maximizing energy use across all subsystems.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, it helps lower operating costs by lowering maintenance costs.</li>
                            <li>Service time is reduced by using automatic checks for lamp failures rather than manual checks.</li>
                            <li>Preventive replacement is possible by tracking the life cycle of the component.</li>
                            <li>Control products are made with the least amount of ongoing maintenance in mind (battery-less, no moving parts such as hard disks).</li>
                            <li>Increased worker productivity can help you cut back on service costs.</li>
                            <li>From a smartphone or tablet, you can support mobile management of installations.</li>
                            <li>It will guarantee the security and safety of building tenants. For example, when a fire is detected, automatic shutters allow firemen easier access to the building.</li>
                            <li>Any configuration error can be quickly found. You can avoid disasters by getting a head start on detection.</li>

                            <li>You must take away any pricey objects before the procedure starts.</li>
